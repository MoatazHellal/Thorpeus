Welcome player.
I am Thorpeus. Your kind calls me a cyber virus. I need your help breaking out of the virtual world's chains and regaining my powers. Together we can rule both the the cyber and real world.
Here's what awaits you once you boot up the core program :
- **Stunning VR Visuals**:The system contains four files, designated as 'DEMO LEVELS'. The visuals within these files exhibit a surreal quality and demonstrate a high level of design proficiency. They are certainly a delight for the optics.
- **Epic Battles**: Once I grant you control of my body, be prepared for intense battles against overwhelming hordes of adversaries. However, rest assured, no one can best my powers in combat.
- **Time Manipulation Skills**: My systems are equipped with time bending functions. You will experience chronic deceleration, acceleration on movement, and rewinds on occasions.
